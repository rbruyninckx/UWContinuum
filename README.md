     * For form that submits to SQL DB:
     * Please view /Views/SignupForm/Index.cshtml for the signup form HTML page view 
     * Controller is /Controllers/SignupFormController.cs
     * Model is /Models/WebEmailsModel.cs
     * Database context for Entity Framework and SQL script to create table is in /Data/ folder
     * If you run the program with localhost, the default index page that loads will be /SignupForm/Index.cshtml
     * Default controller was changed in program.cs
     * 
     * For form that sends data to web service / REST API:
     * Please view /Views/SignupFormWebService/Index.cshtml for the signup for HTML page view (look and behavior is similar to other signup form)
     * Controller is /Controllers/SignupFormWebServiceController.cs (code includes a sample API post and response where the DB submit portion was).
     * The form page view reflects the varied response. 
     * 
     * I hope you find my response to this code exercise to be adequate and to your liking. I appreciate any and all feedback.
     * 
     * Thanks, Ryan
